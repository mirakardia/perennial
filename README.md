# Perennial

## The proposal
“Perennial” is a project with the aim of producing a compelling indie video game with a relatively small team (likely based mostly in Finland). The team should prioritize creating a quality experience that delivers an interactive story based on the vision of its lead designer(s), so a limited scope will be defined based on available human and material resources. The game will be built using the Godot Engine and its packaged programming language GDScript, with other tools defined and developed as necessary. As an auxiliary goal, the team may experiment with implementing and deploying a video game as an open-source project.
