# Perennial: design documentation

## The proposal:

***"Perennial"*** is a project with the aim of producing a **compelling indie video game** with a relatively small team (likely based mostly in Finland). The team should prioritize creating a **quality experience** that delivers an **interactive story** based on the vision of its lead designer(s), so a **limited scope** will be defined based on available human and material resources. The game will be built using the **Godot Engine** and its packaged programming language **GDScript**, with other tools defined and developed as necessary. As an auxiliary goal, the team may experiment with implementing and deploying a **video game as an open-source project**. 

## The team (as of 01/2025):

- **Miranda Sydänmäki** – executive producer, lead game designer, programmer, writer & composer
- **Juuso Sintonen** – co-producer, writer & game designer
- **Roni Sydänmäki** – lead artist & graphic designer
- (Paavo Keski-Orvola – UX/UI & game designer?)
- (Kuura Klaavu – writer & composer?)
- (Eris Sarlund – character artist & graphic designer?)
- (Otava Metsätähti – character artist & graphic designer?)
- (Allan Metsätähti – programmer?)
- (Niklas Linderoos – programmer?)
- (Alex Blomqvist – programmer?)
- (Daniel Tievsky – programmer?)

## The game concept:

***"Perennial"*** is an artistically, aesthetically, and narratively driven **adventure game** featuring an **isometric** perspective, light **RPG elements**, environmental and social **puzzles**, some **roguelite** design patterns, and minimal **combat**. The overall design is primarily inspired by **CRPGs**, **visual novels**, **action adventure games**, and various modern indie games. 

In terms of **gameplay**, Perennial revolves around a loop of **overworld exploration**, reassembling the **player character’s toolkit**, harvesting/planting **flora and fungi**, gathering **water**, avoiding **environmental hazards and "enemies"**, and interacting with a cast of **interesting NPCs** and their **personal questlines**, all the while managing the player character’s **anxiety** and slowly resolving their core **personal conflict**.

(*section under development*)

The list of the most **notable game influences** includes: 

- ***Disco Elysium*** (art direction, worldbuilding, social commentary, gameplay, minimal combat)
- ***Hades*** (art direction, sound design, visual novel storytelling, procedural encounters)
- ***Hyper Light Drifter*** (art direction, sound design, atmosphere, worldbuilding)
- ***Dredge*** (art direction, sound design, worldbuilding, atmosphere, gameplay)
Slay the Spire (procedural encounters)
- **The *Persona* series** (visual novel storytelling, art direction)
- ***The Legend of Zelda* series [pre-BotW]** (puzzle design, progression systems, exploration)

## The artistic vision:

***"Perennial"*** is heavily influenced by the literary genres of **dark fantasy**, **magical realism**, **psychological horror**, and **speculative climate fiction**. It also features an additional, although highly unemphasized allegorical metanarrative of the **transgender experience**, which is not to be made explicitly public, even though its impact on informing the writing and design process is significant. Occasional passages of **poetry** (mostly written in iambic pentameter) are also included within the text. 

The list of the most **notable literary influences** includes: 

- ***Memory of Water*** (Emmi Itäranta) (orig. *Teemestarin kirja*)
- **The *Dune* series** (Frank Herbert)
- ***The Wendigo*** (Algernon Blackwood)
- ***Paradise Lost*** (John Milton)
- ***Berserk*** (Kentaro Miura) (orig. ベルセルク)
- ***My Cat Yugoslavia*** (Pajtim Statovci) (orig. *Kissani Jugoslavia*)
- **Various works by**:
  - Edgar Allan Poe, August Derleth, H. P. Lovecraft, Stephen King, Franz Kafka

The game (hopefully) features **hand-illustrated backgrounds** for its environments. Collidable objects, such as props, buildings, and functionally significant scenery, (will likely) utilize a **combination of hand-illustrated art and 3D models**. Actors, like the player character, NPCs, and enemies, (will likely) utilize **cel-shaded 3D models**, but a **sprite-based** system is also possible. The dialogues feature **hand-illustrated, visual-novel style character art with reactions**. 

## The world:

***"Perennial"*** details a **deeply troubled artisan's** concrete and metaphorical **journey** as they travel through a **world ravaged by a natural disaster** and its physical, psychological, social, and even metaphysical consequences. The earth below and the skies above are **bleak**, and the minds and souls of men are **barren** – enlightenment is but a frivolous pursuit for those few who do not know the **embrace of fear and hunger**. 

**Water**, in particular, is in **short supply**, as most of the world's sources of it have either **dried up**, been **exhausted**, or become **tainted by salt** and dirt. **Disease** spreads like wildfire, and even the very **condition of humanity** seems to have **decayed and distorted** in various ways. The fundamental **cause of the decline is uncertain**, and hugely divergent **rumours and myths** ranging in nature from **ecological and spiritual** to downright **sinister and eldritch** have spread like the accompanying pestilence. Even many of those with **knowledge of the old world** barely dare believe it. 

## The protagonist:

Our **unnamed main character** belongs to a class of **specialists** with many names. In the real world, they have been dubbed **witches**, **black magicians**, **shamans**, **mediums**, and such. However, even the most accurate name, **necromancer**, requires a more detailed description to paint the full picture. For now, we shall agree to call them **"perennials"**, and the main character shall be known to us as **"the protagonist"**. 

On the outside, the protagonist is a **vagrant horticulturist**, and a quite skilled one, too. There is, however, **more to them** than meets the unwitting eye. Although quite **rare among the masses**, many **perennials** like the protagonist walk the wastes of the world, and **where there is water, there is bound to be a perennial**. Their facades are many, but one would often find them offering their service as **gardeners**, **herbal healers**, **farm hands**, and curiously enough, **morticians and gravediggers**. Perennials study, craft and trade in **all aspects of life and death**, and while the same is true for the workers mentioned earlier, for perennials, this **relationship and obsession** with the beginning and the end is **intimate to a hauntingly grotesque extent**. 

You see, unlike their mundane counterparts, **perennials can cultivate life from death**, and this trait manifests itself in forms both metaphorical and literal. **Memories of the departed** are like **seeds and spores** – they merely need **soil as a cradle** and some **careful nurture** in order to develop a **root**, explode into a **bloom**, and even bear **fruit**. A memory can be as **ethereal** and small as a **word of remembrance**, an **elegy** sung by a grieving lover, or **any fading sign** of the deceased left behind in the world. A memory can be as **substantial** and large as a **trinket** previously owned by the mourned, their now **derelict home**, or a **monument** built in their name. For a more **morbidly inclined** perennial, a recovered **organ** or other body part will also suffice. In the end, it comes down to what is **easily available**, and for better or for worse, the **temperament**, **quirks**, and sometimes **perverted imagination** of the individual perennial in question. 

As for the **protagonist in the beginning**, they would rather keep their talents literally **buried underground**, if at all possible. People’s **knowledge of perennials** is about as **scarce and dubious** as their **knowledge of the old world**, so staying out of their sight isn’t usually an issue. However, when an adequately **perceptive or curious person** or **another perennial** actively seeks out their presence, the veil often turns out to be as thin as early winter’s ice. **Attitudes towards perennials also differ** radically from person to person – even **amongst perennials** themselves – which doesn’t necessarily encourage most perennials to **reveal their true natures** unless it is **strictly beneficial or unavoidable**. 

Fortunately, practising the art of **horticulture** generally grants them the **privilege of staying hidden** while also being able to **provide a service** to the people they meet. Unfortunately, our goal is to develop a **melancholy RPG** informed by **speculative fiction**, **dark fantasy** and **magical realism**. This means their days will be perpetually **burdened** by the weight and troubles laid on their shoulders by the **faces they encounter** and the often **hopeless environments** they must traverse, many of which will definitely be easier to lift with the aid of **supernatural arts**. The **scarcity of water** also plays an integral role in the daily hardships suffered by a **caretaker of flora** like our protagonist. Thus, they must be prepared to unearth the **roots** of some **tearful and twisted memories**, plant some rather **tragic and ominous seeds**, and inevitably **reap what was sown**. 

## The plot:

After a short but nightmarish prologue, the story begins with the protagonist waking up in an **unknown house**. Their memory is **foggy and fragmented**, but they are quite certain they recall experiencing a **death by drowning**. An **old woman** greets them, introducing herself as **Leah** (full name **Azalea**), the proprietress of the house, which is revealed to be a **teahouse**. She tells them that she found them **lifelessly drifting** in the nearby **saltwater lake**, and that she dragged them out and brought them to the teahouse some hours ago. 

Although their drenched clothes and other belongings have been hung to dry by Leah, the protagonist is deeply shocked to discover that **most of their tools are missing**, and that their **water flask has cracked**. This – along with **other hints** – confirms Leah’s suspicions that the protagonist is not just an ordinary florist, but a **perennial**, something that she mentions out loud in an **uncannily delighted** manner. Her remark makes the protagonist **visibly anxious** and determined to leave immediately, but Leah manages to calm them down. Leah tells them that she is, in fact, quite **empathetic towards the protagonist and their kind**, since her position as the owner of a teahouse has proven fairly **controversial** among the people of the adjacent **village**. 

Using water to brew tea or coffee is generally seen as something superficial or **insulting** to the plight of the people, so the villagers are **reluctant to sell water** and sometimes even other supplies to Leah. She also laments that it’s hard to **procure quality ingredients** for her infusions. All of this leads Leah to propose a **mutually beneficial deal**: in exchange for further **shelter and upkeep** (and as payback for what she had already done), the protagonist could use their skills and knowledge to supply Leah’s teahouse with **fresh water and ingredients**. The two come to an **agreement**, and after the protagonist gets dressed, they grab their **shovel** (the only tool they still possess) and a **temporary** water flask loaned by Leah, and head out to **investigate the village**.
